# 3DGaussainSplatAssetGeneratorForPython
This repository is created for Python users to generate the same 3D Gaussian Splat Asset that the third-party UnityGaussianSplatting package creates, which can otherwise only be generated from the Unity Editor menu. This means you can now create your own GaussianSplatAsset at runtime in application scenes or on external servers by deploying this repo on your device.
