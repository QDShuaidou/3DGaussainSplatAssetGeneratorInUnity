# 3D Gaussian Splat Asset Generator in Unity 
This repository enables Python users to generate 3D Gaussian Splat  assets identical to those created by the third-party  UnityGaussianSplatting package (https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting), which can normally only be produced through the Unity Editor menu. 

This means you can now produce GaussianSplatAsset files at runtime in your Unity scenes—either by downloading the assets generated by this Python script or by deploying the repository on an external server.





## Install

1. download zip or run `git clone https://github.com/QDShuaidou/3DGaussainSplatAssetGeneratorInUnity.git` to your empty folder as project root folder

2. go to your root folder and inputs:

   ```
   conda create -n gsasset_generator python=3.11
   conda activate gsasset_generator
   ```

   (You can specify your own environment name)

3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`





## Usage

1. put your PLY binary file(xxx.ply) in the root folder (﻿ Located in the same directory as the GaussianSplatAssetGenerator.py)
   ,then rename it as 'point_cloud.ply'
2. run `python GaussianSplatAssetGenerator.py `  



Waiting for a while ,then you can find **xxx.asset** file and **xxx_pos.bytes | xxx_col.bytes | xxx_oth.bytes | xxx_shs.bytes** files have been created in **output** folder. You can drag all files in the output folder directly to the Unity and use them!

there are also some parameters for selection,such as --quality VeryHigh/High/Medium and so on.you can find out from under if __name__ == "__main__": 



## Environment

Python 3.11.14
